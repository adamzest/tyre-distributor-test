# Introduction
The solution included with this document is an exercise to allow you to demonstrate knowledge of modern design principals/patterns. It is not production code – in fact you may find it demonstrates poor practice (it is not representative of the code we produce at Zest).

We’d like you to approach this in the same way you would your day-to-day development, however there is no right answer.

We will use this to gauge your thought process, and see how it aligns with ours.

If we move to a face to face interview, we will discuss your work in more depth.

# Getting Started
The solution is based around a fictional tyre distributor and their ordering system.

The TyreDistributor.Tests project contains an OrderTests test class, which tests the Order class in the main project.

The ‘Order’ class contains the majority of the functionality in the solution.

# Objectives
We would like to see:
-	refactoring to improve the code as you see fit
-	the tests still pass
-	that you focus on the areas you deem most important (we care more about your overall approach than minor syntactical issues)
-	that where you haven’t had time to fully refactor, you have added comments to highlight what you may do if given more time
